\usage{
aco(x, n.ants = 2L, alpha = 1, beta = 2, rho = 0.1, att.factor = 1,
  max.iter = 10L, max.time = Inf, global.opt.value = NULL,
  termination.eps = 0.1, show.info = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{[\code{Network}]\cr
A network, i. e., a graph generated with the netgen package.
See \code{\link[netgen]{makeNetwork}} for details.}

\item{n.ants}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Number of ants. Positive integer.}

\item{alpha}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
This parameter decided how much influence the pheromones on an edge have
on the selection of edges. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{beta}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
This parameter decided how much influence the edges distances have
on the selection of edges.}

\item{rho}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
\dQuote{Pheromone evaporation coefficient} respectively \dQuote{evaporation rate}.
In each iteration the pheromone on edge (i,j) are first decreased by (1 - rho)
before ants deposit their pheromones on it. Must be in (0, 1). Default is \code{0.1}.}

\item{att.factor}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
Constant attractiveness factor. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{max.iter}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Maximal number of iterations. Default is \code{10}.}

\item{max.time}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Maximum running time in seconds. The algorithm tries hard to hold this
restriction by logging the times of a number of prior iterations and
determining statistically whether the time limit can be hold when another
iteration is done. Default ist \code{Inf}, which means no time limit at all.}

\item{global.opt.value}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
Known global best tour length. This can be used as another termination
criterion. Default is \code{NULL}, which means, that the length of the
globally best tour is unknown.}

\item{termination.eps}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
If \code{global.opt.value} is set, the algorithm stops if the quadratic
distance between the global optimum value and the value of the best tour
found so far is lower than these gap value. Ignored if \code{global.opt.value}
is \code{NULL}.}

\item{show.info}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
If \code{TRUE}, which is the default value, some information is printed to
the standard output during execution. Default is \code{FALSE}, which means
that the algorithm behaves like a typical Unix terminal program. It stops
on failure with a cryptic message and stops on success with no message.}
}
\value{
[\code{AntsResult}]
  S3 object containing the result.
